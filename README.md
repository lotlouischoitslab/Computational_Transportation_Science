# Transportation Engineering 
Operation, management, control, design, evaluation of passenger and freight transportation systems. Traffic theory, introductory road design, air transportation, rail transportation, water transportation, and an introduction to both Autonomous Vehicles and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for futuristic Smart Cities. Extensive use of Python and Excel will be used to analyze and forecast transportation data. </br>
**Prerequisites: MATH 257 Linear Algebra with Computational Applications; </br> CS 124 Introduction to Computer Science 1 or CS 101 Introduction to Computing for Scientists & Engineers**

## Lecture Attendance:
- Please go to lecture to meet new friends and professors. You will have a much diverse understanding of how transportation engineering is applied into many different fields in our society. 

## Prairielearn Assignments:
- Each homework will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery in the material taught in that particular unit. This gets rid of the burden both TAs and CAs have on grading tons of written assignments which takes forever.

## Quizzes:
- Multiple-choice quizzes will be tested on that particular unit. Students must register for the Computer-Based Testing Facility so they could pick a time to take the quiz in a given time slot. The main reason for the CBTF environment is to prevent cheating. 

## Group Computational Problems:
- Group of 4 will work on data science and engineering problems to analyze various transportation data using Python and Excel.

## Final Presentation:
- Teams of 4 will do a case study on a public transportation system in a city to explore and record a video of their final presentation. The winning team of the best presentation will get an extra credit of 1% for each group member in the winning team!  

## Extra Credits:
- Numerous extra credit opportunities at instructor's choice.
