# Transportation Engineering 
Operation, management, control, design, evaluation of passenger and freight transportation systems. Traffic theory, introductory road design, air transportation, rail transportation, water transportation, and an introduction to both Autonomous Vehicles and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for futuristic Smart Cities. Extensive use of Python and Excel will be used to analyze and forecast transportation data. </br>
**Prerequisites: MATH 257 Linear Algebra with Computational Applications; </br> CS 124 Introduction to Computer Science 1 or CS 101 Introduction to Computing for Scientists & Engineers**

## Proposed Grading:
- **5% Lecture Attendance**
- **15% Final Presentation**
- **20% Prairielearn Assignments**
- **20% Computer-based Testing Facility (CBTF) Quizzes**
- **40% Group Computational Problems**
- **Extra credits at instructor's choice**

## Lecture Attendance:
- Please go to lecture to meet new friends and professors.

## Prairielearn Assignments
- Each homework will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery in the material taught in that unit. This gets rid of the burden both TAs and CAs have on grading tons of written assignments.

## Group Computational Problems:
- Group of 4 will work on data science and engineering problems to analyze transportation data using Python and Excel.

## Final Presentation
- From the group computation problem assignments, teams of 4 will do a case study on a public transportation system.
