# Computational Transportation Science
Operation, management, control, design, evaluation of passenger and freight transportation systems. Traffic theory, introductory road design, air transportation, rail transportation, and an introduction to both Autonomous Vehicles and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for futuristic Smart Cities. Extensive use of Python and Excel will be used to analyze and forecast transportation data. </br>

# Teaching Guidelines:
"Stay infront of the slow-moving freight train." - John S. Popovics
## Proposed Grading:
- **5% Lecture Attendance**
- **5% Reading Assignments**
- **20% Prairielearn Assignments**
- **20% Case Studies**
- **25% Final Presentations**
- **25% Group Computational Problems**
- **Extra Credits**

## Proposed Grading Scale:

  |Percentage | Letter Grade | |
  | ---|---|---|
  | 95 | A+|
  | 90 | A |
  | 85 | A-|
  | 80 | B+|
  | 75 | B |
  | 70 | B-|
  | 65 | C+|
  | 60 | C |
  | 55 | C-|
  | 50 | D+|
  | 45 | D |
  | 40 | D-|
  | 0  | F | ~1%|
  
Adjusted Grades:

$$Finalgrade = \lceil{ \sqrt{rawgrade }} \rceil + extracredits$$

Don't worry everyone, I will make the grading as lenient as possible. If you got a flat 90.0% overall, then you will get a flat 90.0%. If you get a floating point number of 90.00125% or 90.6763% or 90.9998%, you will be rounded up to 91%.

### IMPORTANT!
**UIUC CEE 310 Transportation Engineering is run independently. I am NOT using their grading scale to compute what the proposed transportation engineering course's final grading will be like. If you are an undergraduate student at UIUC who needs course credit AND letter grade for CEE 310, please take their course. Official course description of UIUC CEE 310 can be found here: [CEE 310](https://cee.illinois.edu/academics/courses/CEE310)**

## Lecture Attendance:
- Please go to lecture to meet new friends and professors. You will have a much diverse understanding of how transportation engineering is applied into many different fields in our modern society. 3 of your lecture attendances will be dropped.

## Reading Assignments:
- Reading assignments from certain portion from a textbook or an article related to transportation engineering will be given out. Once students have completed their reading assignments, a short homework problem on the text will be given out and it will be due until the beginning of next lecture. Multiple attempts will be given so students can have enough time to absorb the content. 

## Prairielearn Assignments:
- Each homework will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery in the material taught in that particular unit. This gets rid of the burden both TAs and CAs have on grading tons of written assignments which takes forever. **The lowest homework assignment will be dropped.**

## Case Studies:
- Individual case studies (can be done up to 2 people) on a unit in transportation will be performed by students. Visual data analysis can be used to describe the recent transportation/traffic changes that have taken place for the student(s)' respective case study analysis. **Everyone is required to complete the case studies.**

## Final Presentations:
- Teams of 4 will present on a given topic for a unit in transportation they are interested covered in the course and record a video of their presentations. **The winning team of the best presentation will get an extra credit of 1% for each group member in the winning team! Everyone is required to participate in the mini-presentations.**

## Group Computational Problems:
- Group of 4 will work on data science and engineering problems to analyze various transportation data using Python and Excel. Group activities will not only enhance students skills in data computation, but also effective communicative skills necessary to be successful in the modern transportation academia and industry. Each group activity will be given 2 weeks for completion. **2 of your lowest group computational problems will be dropped.**

## Extra Credits:
- Numerous extra credit opportunities at instructor's choice.
