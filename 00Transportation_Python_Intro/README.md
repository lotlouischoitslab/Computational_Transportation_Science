# Python Tutorial

## Instructions:
  1. You can either use Google Colab or your own Jupyter Notebook if you have Anaconda Python installed and downloaded on your local machine. If not, you will have to download this entire folder which contains all the datasets you will be working on with the Python stuff I organized. Make sure to name your folder **00Transportation_Python_Intro** if you are going to download this folder onto your local Google Drive account. When mounting this folder into Google drive, be sure to rename your file path as **"path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/00Transportation_Python_Intro/datasets/'"**.
  2. Fill out the 00Louis_Python_Intro_Blank and 01Louis_Python_Continued_Blank while you follow the tutorial video I will attach here:
